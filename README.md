We wanted to do something we have never done before. Distracted driving is a huge problem facing our society. As our project for HackEd Fall 2016, we created an Android app designed to promote safe driving practices. With this app on, all calls would be blocked. If the same caller has called two times already, the third call would not be blocked. In addition, we utilized a Bluetooth OBDII reader that able to record data (speed, fuel, mileage, etc.) from the car's computer and send it to the user's phone via bluetooth. 

By the end of the 24 hour Hackathon, our team, using Andriod Studio for the first time, managed to have call blocking working, as well as display speed and RPM from the OBDII reader. 

# Future Plans
After 24 hours we finished one phase one the project, but this is only the beginning! Here are our future goals:
- Deciphering and displaying engine problems
- If user is speeding in a company car, log speeding and send report to employer
- If low on fuel, get directions to nearest gas station
- Improve app interface
- Fix call bug pertaining to running in the backrground
